# University-ML-Projects

This repository contains the code for my Machine Learning projects completed as part of my bachelor studies at the university.

## Description
Here is short description of each of the folders - one folder contains project(s) done for one course.

- advanced-machine-learning
  
    This folder contains two projects that my [friend](https://github.com/kalinajazdzyk) and I completed together. 
  - The first project involves implementing logistic regression with four different optimizers: gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, ADAM, and iterative weighted least squares. 
  - The second project involves exploring various feature selection methods to identify important features in a dataset provided by our lecturer.

  Additionally, I have also uploaded exercises that I completed during my classes, which involve implementing and using various machine learning methods.
- big-data
    
     Me and three of my friends created end2end solution using Apache framework. 
- deep-learning
    
   I've implemented three convolutional neural networks architectures with different data augmentation techniques.
- machine-learning-on-graphs

   Together with my [friend](https://github.com/gozderamichal) we've implemented [diff2vec](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07463) (for extracting node embeddings) algorithm and tried to enhance it with auto-encoders with additional Contrastive Loss. 
- polish-coin-detection
    
    My [friend](https://github.com/mateuszkierznowski) and I created a small dataset of Polish coins, including their bounding boxes and values. We then implemented several classifiers and detection mechanism using this dataset.
- time-series-classification
  
  To pass this course, I implemented the rocket algorithm for time series classification as described in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13051).
- web-scrapping 

  Additionally, [here](https://github.com/OpenCS-ontology/csis-annals-scraper) is a public repository of a computer science ontology to which my [friend](https://github.com/mateuszkierznowski) and I contributed.
