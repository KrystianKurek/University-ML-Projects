# University-ML-Projects

This repository contains the code for my Machine Learning projects completed as part of my bachelor studies at the university.

## Description
Each folder in this repository contains the projects I completed for a specific course, along with relevant 
exercises and implementations. Here's a brief overview of each folder:

- **advanced-machine-learning**: This folder contains two projects completed in collaboration with my [friend](https://github.com/kalinajazdzyk). The first project involves implementing logistic regression with different optimizers, while the second project explores feature selection methods for identifying important features in a dataset. Additionally, I have also uploaded exercises that I completed during my classes, which involve implementing and using various machine learning methods.
- **big-data**: In collaboration with three friends, I created an end-to-end solution using the Apache framework.
- **deep-learning**: I implemented three convolutional neural network architectures using different data augmentation techniques.
- **machine-learning-on-graphs**: In collaboration with my [friend](https://github.com/gozderamichal), we implemented the [diff2vec](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07463) algorithm for node embeddings and enhanced it with auto-encoders and a Contrastive Loss.

- **polish-coin-detection**: My [friend](https://github.com/mateuszkierznowski) and I created a small dataset of Polish coins, including their bounding boxes and values. We then implemented several classifiers and detection mechanism using this dataset.
- **time-series-classification**: For this course, I implemented the rocket algorithm for time series classification as described in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13051).
- **web-scrapping**: In addition, my [friend](https://github.com/mateuszkierznowski) and I contributed to a public repository of a computer 
science ontology, which can be found [here](https://github.com/OpenCS-ontology/csis-annals-scraper).
