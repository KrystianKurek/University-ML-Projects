During classes, I had to complete tasks given by laboratory instructor. They covered implementing (or/and) using machine learning algorithms and evaluating them.
Main topics we covered are: 
* LDA, QDA, logistic regression and SVM
* Decision trees
* Model evaluation techniques (Cross Validation)
* Kernel density estimation
* Non-linear regression (MARS)
* Ensembles (Bagging, Boosting)
* Feature selection
* Clustering
