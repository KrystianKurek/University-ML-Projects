This folder does not contain files, as all the code is [here](https://github.com/OpenCS-ontology/csis-annals-scraper).
It is a public repository of a computer science ontology that my [friend](https://github.com/mateuszkierznowski) 
and I contributed to.
    
We were asked to scrape volumes from 1 to 32 from https://annals-csis.org/, which is website of Annals of 
Computer Science and Information Systems - scientific journal that publishes 
research articles in the field of computer science. We downloaded those articles and scraped basic 
information from them, including author, title, DOI identifier, abstract, and more.

This information is stored in TTL files.
